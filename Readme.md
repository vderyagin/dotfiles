Collection of my dotfiles, semi-automatically managed by
[thor](https://github.com/wycats/thor) script (dotfiles.thor, included in
repository).

Script provides three commands:

```
thor dotfiles:add FILENAME...     # add files to repository
thor dotfiles:remove FILENAME...  # remove files from repository
thor dotfiles:list                # list managed files
```
